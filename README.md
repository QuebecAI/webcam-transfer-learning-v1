# Transfer Learning to play Pacman via the Webcam

This example shows you how to predict poses from a webcam using transfer learning.

In this example, we're deploying a pretrained [MobileNet](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples/tree/master/mobilenet) model and training another model
using an internal mobilenet activation to predict 4 different classes from the webcam defined by the user.

Thank you [TensorFlow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org) for your flexible and intuitive APIs.
